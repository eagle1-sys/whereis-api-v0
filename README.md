# Eagle1 whereis API

## Goal
The goal of this project is to solve one problem: to track the current location of a shipment through the simplest possible API query.

## Concept
Since different logistics providers have their own data formats and APIs, integrating various logistics data poses a significant challenge for app developers.

## Track the location
